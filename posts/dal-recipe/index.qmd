## Introduction

I wanted to try writing about what I had for lunch today.  

Dal is a North Indian/South Asian dish that is made from red/yellow lentils.

## Recipe

**Ingredients:**  

- 1 red onion, chopped
- 1 tomato, chopped
- 1 tbsp Ginger-garlic paste
- 3-4 Indian/Thai green chilies, slit
- 2 dried red chili
- 1 tsp Cumin seeds
- 1 cup toor dal/masoor dal (available at your local South Asian store/Walmart)
- 3-4 tbsp cooking oil

**Steps:**  

1. First cook the 1 cup dal. I like to use a pressure cooker to do so (4 whistles; 1:2 - dal:water), but you can also boil it for about 30 mins or until it becomes soft and mushy.
2. Mash the dal and keep it aside.
3. Next, to a pan, add oil and let it warm up.
4. Add cummin seeds, dried red chili and slit green chilies and wait for 2-3 minutes.
5. Now, add the chopped red onion and ginger-garlic paste. Sautee it till it turns transparent.
6. Add the tomatoes and stir until it's cooked, which should take no more than 6-7 mins.
7. Add the mashed dal and stir.
8. Add salt to taste, 1 tsp red chili powder, 1sp coriander powder, 1 tsp garam masala and a pinch of turmeric.
9. Mix everything well.
10. Add some water and let it simmer.
11. Fix the spices to taste and let it cool.
12. Add some ghee on top (optional) and enjoy!
