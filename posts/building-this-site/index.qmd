## Introduction

Welcome to my first blog post! In this article, I'll walk you through how I built this website using Quarto, a modern publishing system that's particularly well-suited for academic and technical content.

## Why Quarto?

As a bioinformatics PhD student, I needed a platform that could:

1. **Handle Technical Content**: Support for code blocks, mathematical equations, and scientific notation
2. **Be Easy to Maintain**: Simple markdown-based content creation
3. **Look Professional**: Clean, responsive design without extensive CSS work
4. **Support Blogging**: Easy way to share research insights and tutorials
5. **Integrate with GitHub**: Seamless version control and deployment

Quarto checked all these boxes and more. It's built by Posit (formerly RStudio) and is designed specifically for creating scientific and technical documents.

## Website Structure

This website has a simple but effective structure:

### Home Page (CV)
The landing page features my curriculum vitae, showcasing my education, experience, projects, and publications. Using Quarto's `about` page template with the "jolla" style gives it a clean, professional look with social media links prominently displayed.

### Blog Section
A dedicated blog area where I can share:
- Research insights and findings
- Tutorials on bioinformatics tools and techniques
- Career reflections and advice
- Conference experiences

Each blog post lives in its own directory under `posts/`, which makes it easy to organize post-specific assets like images and data files.

## Technology Stack

Here's what powers this website:

- **Quarto**: The static site generator that converts markdown files into HTML
- **GitHub**: Version control for tracking all changes
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated CI/CD pipeline that builds and deploys the site
- **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting for the published website

## Automated Deployment with GitHub Actions

One of the best features of this setup is the automated deployment pipeline. Every time I push changes to the main branch:

1. GitHub Actions triggers automatically
2. The workflow sets up Quarto in a clean environment
3. Quarto renders all `.qmd` files into HTML
4. The generated `_site/` directory is deployed to GitHub Pages
5. The website updates within minutes

This means I can focus on writing content without worrying about the build and deployment process.

## The Build Process

Here's what happens when Quarto builds the site:

```bash
quarto render
```

This single command:
- Processes all `.qmd` (Quarto markdown) files
- Applies the theme and styling from `_quarto.yml`
- Generates the blog listing page
- Creates navigation structure
- Outputs a complete static website in `_site/`

## Project Configuration

The heart of the website is the `_quarto.yml` configuration file, which defines:

- **Project type**: Website
- **Navigation structure**: Home and Blog pages
- **Theme**: Cosmo (a clean, professional Bootstrap theme)
- **Social links**: GitHub and LinkedIn
- **Output directory**: `_site/`

## Adding New Blog Posts

Creating a new blog post is straightforward:

1. Create a new directory under `posts/` with a descriptive name
2. Add an `index.qmd` file with YAML frontmatter
3. Write the content in markdown
4. Push to GitHub - the site automatically rebuilds!

Example frontmatter:
```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
description: "Brief description"
author: "Your Name"
date: "2026-02-17"
categories: [category1, category2]
---
```

## Features I Love

### Clean URLs
Each blog post gets a clean URL structure: `yoursite.com/posts/post-name/`

### Automatic Listings
The blog listing page automatically updates with new posts, sorted by date, with categories and descriptions.

### Responsive Design
The site looks great on mobile, tablet, and desktop without any extra work.

### Fast and Lightweight
As a static site, it loads incredibly quickly and requires no server-side processing.

## Future Improvements

Here are some enhancements I'm considering:

- Adding a search functionality
- Including code execution for interactive examples
- Adding images and visualizations to posts
- Creating a projects showcase page
- Adding RSS feed for blog subscribers
- Implementing comments system (possibly via GitHub discussions)

## Getting Started with Your Own Site

If you're interested in creating a similar website, here are the basic steps:

1. Install Quarto from [quarto.org](https://quarto.org)
2. Create a `_quarto.yml` configuration file
3. Write your content in `.qmd` files
4. Preview locally with `quarto preview`
5. Set up GitHub Actions for deployment
6. Configure GitHub Pages in your repository settings

## Conclusion

Building this website with Quarto has been a rewarding experience. The combination of simplicity, power, and automation makes it an excellent choice for academic and technical professionals who want to maintain a professional web presence without getting bogged down in web development complexities.

I'm excited to use this platform to share my research journey, tutorials, and insights. Stay tuned for more posts about bioinformatics, genomics, and computational biology!
